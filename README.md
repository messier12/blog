# blog

Inspired by [frankmcsherry's blog](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog), I figured I should put things I wrote in my Obsidian and Notion here (after some editing so it might take a while). 
Some of you might ask, "why not github page", I'm not putting it in a github pages so that I could focus more on the content in the future instead of thinking how to make the page looks cool. 
The writings here will be random, but it would probably filled mostly with computer science and robotics related stuff.
